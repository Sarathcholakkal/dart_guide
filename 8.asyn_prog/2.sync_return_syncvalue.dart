//!sync function return a future value
// Synchronous: code is processed from top to bottom, so the next line is not passed until processed in the above line is finished.Â  This structure operations take a long time,

// Asynchronous: Different tasks are carried out at the same time, and work is divided into different parts all operations are carried out at the same time.
//Â This asynchronousÂ  Operation allows to run the program while waiting for another process to finish.

//In asynchronous program code, when the Future delayed is running another part of the code does not stay ideal,
//it works concurrent  and makes its result. andÂ  Â When the method executions finish it also shows the result. there is no need to wait to execute the method.

  });
}

// ðŸ‘© Mom tells ðŸ‘¦ boy to buy milk.

// ðŸ‘¦ The boy leaves â€” but doesn't come back immediately.

// The main function doesnâ€™t wait â€” it immediately moves on and says:Instance of 'Future<String>'
